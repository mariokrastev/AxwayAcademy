Gosho is a good boy. He is coding on Java every free second of his life.
Gosho have a friend named Ivan. They had to make a game in Axway Academy as a project with
main character named Stela. Actually they got help by their
friend - the great Senior Developer - Joreto. They decide to have some rules:

1. Gosho will make the skeleton of the game.
2. Nobody will fill the empty methods code blocks.
3. Ivan will make the collisions.
4. Joreto will make everything else in the game.

The game was really awesome thanks to ideas of Joreto.
On the defence of the project Andrey understoot that their game is not created by them
and told them to create a very simple game for 3 hours in the office. They failed. End of story.
