Pesho is a good boy. He is coding on Python every free second of his life.
Pesho have a friend named Petkan. They had to make a game in Axway Academy as a project with
main character named Silvia. Actually they got help by their
friend - the great Junior QA - Stiliyan. They decide to have some rules:

1. Pesho will make the skeleton of the game.
2. Somebody will fill the empty methods code blocks.
3. Petkan will make the collisions.
4. Stiliyan will make everything else in the game.

The game was really awesome thanks to ideas of Stiliyan.
On the defence of the project Andrew understoot that their game is not created by them
and told them to create a very simple game for 3 hours in the office. They succeed. End of story.
